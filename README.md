## Project Overview
This project explores emerging design patterns and best practices for quantum software development, using leading frameworks like Qiskit, PennyLane, Cirq, and Q#. We aim to compare these patterns with traditional classical software design patterns and develop new metrics for assessing the quality, efficiency, and scalability of quantum applications.

## Why It Matters
As quantum computing advances, the need for standardized design guidelines and performance metrics becomes crucial. This project addresses those gaps, helping to lay the groundwork for efficient and scalable quantum software development.

## Research Questions
1. What are the emerging design patterns and best practices for quantum development in Qiskit, PennyLane, Cirq, and Q#?
2. How do quantum design patterns differ from classical ones used in traditional software?
3. What metrics can we use to assess the quality, efficiency, and scalability of quantum software?
